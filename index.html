<p>
  I am Vladimir, or in short Vlad. I studied computer science at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener">EPFL</a>.
  Currently I am based in Switzerland and I work as a Machine Learning Engineer in deep learning for natural language
  and signal processing.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout the studies and my day-to-day work I developed a passion on explaining and presenting the phenomena
  through the prism of captivating animations and visualizations. I think that's the best way to digests any
  concept and complement our knowledge before delving into the depths.
</p>

<p>
  Following my passion, I started creating visualizations and animations sometimes thoroughly elaborated
  in a blog post. This was the major reason for which I created <b>iSquared</b>, a common place to share
  my knowledge and passion with the rest of the world.
