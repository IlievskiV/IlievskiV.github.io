<p>
    Drawing snowflakes is easy, it only takes to know some simple math. We can mathematically construct a perfect snowflake
    by following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Koch Snowflake</a>
    algorithm. It is also known as a <i>Koch curve</i> and it is a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener">fractal</a>
    line. That means the line shows the same pattern of irregularity regardless of the scale at which we see it. The
    <i>Koch Snowflake</i> as a closed polygon has a fascinating property of infinite length and finite area.
</p>

<p>
    So, how do we construct such an intricating polygon? We start with an <i>equilateral triangle</i> (all sides are equal)
    and for each line we recursively and infinitely repeat the following steps:
    <ul>
        <li>divide the line in three equal parts</li>
        <li>remove the line in the middle</li>
        <li>draw an equilateral triangle above the removed middle part</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    To understand this process in a better way, it is always good to make an
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _blog/2020-02-08-interactive-dataviz.html %}" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">animated visualization</a>.
    For this reason, we implement the described algorithm in Python and visualize it using the Matplotlib's Animation API.
    Thus, the process is perfectly illustrated in the animation below:
