<p>
    There are many ways to approximate <i>Pi</i>. The most basic one which has a nice geometrical interpretation
    is shown below. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Monte Carlo</a>
    style of approximation, such that we randomly throw points in a unit square which contains quarter of a circle.
    Then, the value of <i>Pi</i> is simply the ratio between the points inside the quarter circle and all generated
    points multiplied by 4. We can observe one such simulation below:

<p>
    Although this has a nice geometrical interpretation, it is not an effective method to approximate <i>Pi</i>.
