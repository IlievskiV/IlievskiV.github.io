<p>
    If the path of a Brownian Motion reaches a value <i>'a'</i> at time <i>t=s</i>, the reflected Brownian Motion
    <i>2a - W(t)</i> from that point and so on, has the exact probability of occurring as the original process. This is
    known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_principle_(Wiener_process)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflection Principle</a>
    and we can observe it below:
