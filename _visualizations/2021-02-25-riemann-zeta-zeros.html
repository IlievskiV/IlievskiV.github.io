<p>
    Perceived as the "holy grail" of mathematics, the <b>Riemann Hypothesis</b> which revolves around
    the <b>Riemann Zeta</b> function provokes fascination and admiration. Its solution paves the way
    in predicting the pattern in which the prime numbers occur, the building block of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>Riemann Zeta</b> function is quite simple. It is defined as:
</p>

<div style="font-size:200%">
    \[ \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}, s \in \mathbb{C}, n \in \mathbb{N} \]
</div>

<p>
    where \( s = \sigma + t \times i \) is any complex number, while \( n \) is any natural number.
</p>

<h2>Riemann Hypothesis: where the magic happens</h2>

<p>
    When the real part of the complex number \( s \equiv \sigma \) is greater than one, the sum always converges.
    However, with a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">analytic continuation</a>,
    it is possible to extend the <i>domain of definition</i> for cases when the real part \( \sigma \) is less than 1.
</p>

<p>
    And here is where the magic happens! Riemann hypothesized that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function
    lie on the line \( s = 1/2 + t \times i \). Using a computer simulation this has been verified for
    10,000,000,000,000 (ten trillion) solutions. However, a bulletproof mathematical demonstration is still missing,
    for which the <a href="http://www.claymath.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clay Mathematics Institute</a>
    is giving a million-dollar prize.
</p>

<p>
    If this hypothesis shows to be correct, the <i>Riemann Zeta</i> zeros can be used to approximate the density of the
    prime numbers almost perfectly. It means we will know the pattern in which the prime numbers occur.
</p>

<h2>Visualizing the zeros</h2>

<p>
    Even though it is still a hypothesis, nothing prevents us from visualizing how the function behaves for all
    hypothesized zeros. Using <i>Python</i> and the <i>Matplotlib Animation API</i> it is quite straightforward to
    do this.
</p>

<p>
    In this specific example, first we set \( s = \sigma + t \times i = 1/2 + t \times i \). Then, we generate 10,000
    equidistant values for \( t \) in the space between 0 and 100 and calculate \( s \) for all of them.
    We plug these values inside the zeta function, which will result in another series of complex numbers.
    We take the real and imaginary parts of this zeta function output and plot them against each other.
    The resulting trajectory is animated below:

    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    It is interesting to see how the hypothesized zeros are oscillating in the same region around the coordinate center
    forming an <i>onion-like</i> pattern.

<h2>Appendix: Absurd or not?</h2>

<p>
    Using the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta function, we can plug \( s = -1 \) and get the
    sum of all natural numbers:
</p>

<div style="font-size:200%">
    \[ \zeta(-1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{-1}} = 1 + 2 + 3 + ...  \]
</div>

<p>
    One might expect that this sum will be infinite, but in this realm of analytic continuation, it holds that:
</p>

<div style="font-size:200%">
    \[ \zeta(-1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{-1}} = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... = -\frac{1}{12} \]
</div>

<p>
    Pretty absurd, right?
