    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mandelbrot set</a>
    is a special set of complex numbers that has fascinating properties. It consists of all complex numbers \( c \)
    for which the sequence \( z_{n+1} = z_{n}^{2} + c, z_{0} = 0 \) is bounded.
</p>

<p>
    If we visualize all such complex numbers in the complex plane, such that we associate with them a color representing
    the number of iterations before they diverge, we get a fascinating plot. The shape is so intricate that we can
    always zoom-in and never go out of finer detail. In fact, the boundary of the <i>Mandelbrot set</i> is a <i>fractal:</i>
    it means it has an infinite perimeter and finite area. It also means it is nowhere differentiable.
</p>

<p>
    Using <i>Python</i> and <i>Matplotlib's</i> Animation API, we implement and visualize the convergence
    of the <i>Mandelbrot set</i> as the number of iterations increases. This is illustrated in the animation below:
