With this command line tool we can find boilerplate code snippets significantly faster at no cost. Find out how in the following geeky coffee break.

# What
In this geeky coffee break we reveal the [cht.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh){:target="_blank"} command line tool. This command line tool
can automate a good deal of a programmer's work as it is a real cheat sheet for programmers. We can leverage **cht.sh** to find code snippets and boilerplate
code in 56 different languages (Python, shell, Go, Lua, etc.) using text descriptions.

# Why
Boilerplate code is boring, we don't dedicate attention and tend to forget it immediately. Yet, we need the boilerplate snippets over and over
in different projects, iPy Notebooks and so on. In order to automate their retrieval we can use tools such as **cht.sh**.

# How

After the successful [installation](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh#installation){:target="_blank"} of the **cht.sh** we can immediately start using it.
We will demonstrate how to use for searching Python code snippets.

First we have to start the client by running the following command:

```bash
$ cht.sh --shell python
```
<br/>

Then we start writing queries using natural language. For example we can type **load a json file** which will result in finding the
following snippet:

```python
import json
with open('strings.json') as f:
    d = json.load(f)
    print(d)
```
<br/>

Pretty cool, huh? Below is an illustration on running **cht.sh** for different queries.
