<p>
    In the following series of blog posts, we make a recension of different <strong>JavaScript</strong> visualization
    libraries divided by their main functionality. We cover the following visualization categories :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Charting: producing the common DataViz charts. For instance line, bar and area charts;</li>
    <li>Graphs: for plotting, manipulating and analyzing graph-based data;</li>
    <li>Maps: for representing data that has geographical features and</li>
    <li>3D: creating three-dimensional charts as well as animations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The <strong>goal</strong> is to show the advantages and disadvantages of each framework. This is quite important to know
    when searching what JavaScript visualization toolkit to use. We can see a nice landscape in the image
    above of some of the available options among these categories. In this blog post, we will only analyze
    the charting data visualization tools with hands-on experience for some of them.
</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>
    In all coding demos, we use the life expectancy dataset. This dataset was originally downloaded from
    Our World In Data <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy" target="_blank" rel=”noopener”>analysis</a>
    on life expectancy around the globe. The dataset consists of the life expectancy of every country as well as
    continents in the world through the years. We re-structure the data for the needs of our demos using this
    <a href="https://github.com/IlievskiV/Amusive-Blogging-N-Coding/blob/master/JavaScript%20Visualization%20Zoo/data/life_expectancy_transform.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python notebook</a>.
</p>

<h2>Charting Tools</h2>

<p>
    There are plenty of tools for charting. That gives us an opportunity and flexibility to choose one that well
    suits our needs. In the top-left corner of the image above, we see some of the popular charting <i>JavaScript</i>
    tools. This list is not exhaustive of course, there are many other libraries not included here.
</p>

<p>
    More or less, all these tools enable the developers to easily pick one and quickly reproduce the most common
    and essential charts. We will more thoroughly analyze as well as give a coding example for <i>NVD3</i>,
    <i>Plotly JS</i>, and <i>ApexCharts JS</i>.
</p>

<h2>NVD3: À-propos</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://nvd3.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NVD3</a> is an open-source library
    and it is based on <i>D3</i>. Its aim is to bring the power of <i>D3</i> while removing all unnecessary details
    and make the chart reproduction as smooth as possible. With its simple look, it can easily serve in the financial
    and more scientific sectors.
</p>

<h3>Popularity and maintainability</h3>

<p>
    The open-source <a href="https://github.com/novus/nvd3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub repository</a>
    is quite popular with 7000 stars and 2200 forks. Officially, the library is used in 2700 other repositories.
    Besides the active contributors, the library is additionally maintained and supported by a company named
    <a href="https://www.novus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Novus</a>.
    That might be one more indication that the library is actively developed.
</p>

<p>
    Although the main GitHub repository is quite popular there is no development activity in the repository for
    a long time. The development is moved to another not so popular
    <a href="https://github.com/nvd3/nvd3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">repository</a>, in order to make
    it compatible with version 4 of D3.
</p>

<h3>Palette of charts </h3>
<p>
    <i>NVD3</i> provides a decent amount of easily reproducible charts. On the
    <a href="http://nvd3.org/examples/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official page</a> of examples,
    we can see that it provides <i>single</i> and <i>multi-line charts</i>, <i>scatter</i> and <i>bubble charts</i>
    as well as <i>discrete</i>, <i>grouped</i> and <i>stacked bar charts</i>. On top of this, it provides a
    <i>stacked area</i>, <i>pie</i> and <i>bullet charts</i>.
</p>

    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Figure 1:</i> NVD3 chart gallery.
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>
    To show the capabilities of <i>NVD3</i> we make a multiline plot using our life expectancy dataset. The data
    for every line must be formatted in the following format in order to be consumed by the tool:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nvd3_data_format.png" class="lazyload" align="NVD3 data format in JSON">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    where the <i>key</i> is the name of the line to appear in the plot and <i>values</i> is a list of objects where each
    object contains two values <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, denoting each <i>(x, y)</i> pair to appear in the plot for
    that line.
</p>

<p>
    First, we have to load the data. For this reason, as in every <i>D3</i> application, we define the plotting logic
    inside the callback function of the <i>d3.json</i> method:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nvd3_function.png" class="lazyload" alt="NVD3 function signature">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    After the successful data loading, from the set of charts, we select an interactive line chart with
    the following code:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nvd3_line_chart_def.png" class="lazyload" alt="NVD3 line chart definition">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    We restrict the values on the y-axis to be between 0 and 80. Then we set the labels and the ticks
    of the x and y-axis:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nvd3_x_y_axis.png" class="lazyload" alt="NVD3 set x and y axis options">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    In the end, we only associate the loaded data to the defined line chart and set it to gradually draw in half
    a second (500 milliseconds):
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nvd3_data_binding.png" class="lazyload" alt="NVD3 data binding">
</center>
<br/>

<p>Finally, the chart is depicted in the image below. You can try it on your own
    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/nvd3_index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nvd3-line-chart.png" class="lazyload" alt="NVD3 multiline chart">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Figure 2:</i> NVD3 Multi-line chart for the life expectancy data. Try it
        <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/nvd3_index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </span>
</center>


<h3>Last words</h3>

<p>
    As we can see, it is quite easy and straightforward to produce a line chart using <i>NVD3</i>. The colors of each
    line are automatically generated. On top of this, the chart is interactive, showing the current values for each
    line in a box as we slide through it.
</p>

<p>
    The legend is by default displayed in the right top corner and allows us to select what lines to display
    on the grid. One nice feature is, by clicking one item in the legend, we can disable the associated line.
    Moreover, by double-clicking the item, we select only that particular line. If we double-click again the same item,
    we enable all lines.
</p>

<p>
    However, it is not possible by default to select a subset of values and zoom over them. This is very useful
    when we have many values on the x-axis and multiple lines that might vary over different regions.
</p>

<h2>Plotly JS: À-propos</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plotly JS</a> is a popular open-source
    JavaScript library built on top of <i>D3</i>. The aim is to provide organizations with a powerful tool to
    build analytics apps in order to propagate the message of the data more efficiently. It has a simple and
    neat UI that can serve many purposes: building data dashboards, presenting scientific results and data,
    developing web and mobile applications.
</p>


<h3>Popularity and maintainability</h3>
<p>
    The official <a href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub repo</a>
    is very popular with more than 11000 stars and 1300 forks. The development is quite active with every day
    commits and fixes. Moreover, the codebase is used in another 3700 repositories.
</p>

<p>
    Apart from this, <i>Plotly</i> as a company is quite successful with a lot of funding, partners, clients, and
    monthly active users. All of this is a guarantee for the quality and freshness of the codebase.
</p>

<h3>Palette of charts </h3>
<p>
    This library covers a wide range of charts, counting more than 40 different types of charts, all listed on the
    official <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">examples page</a>.
    First of all, there are some basic charts like <i>line</i>, <i>bar</i> and <i>pie charts</i>, as well as the,
    <i>scatter plots</i>. On top of this, we have the basic statistical charts like <i>box plots</i>,
    <i>histograms</i> and <i>error bars</i>. This list of more scientific charts is augmented with
    <i>contour plots</i>, <i>heatmaps</i> and <i>radar</i>, and <i>polar charts</i>.
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plotly_examples.png" class="lazyload" alt="Plotly JS chart gallery">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Figure 3:</i> Plotly JS chart gallery.
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    There is support for plotting financial data. In this sector, we have a <i>waterfall</i>, <i>funnel</i>,
    <i>bullet</i> and <i>candlestick charts</i>. Moreover, <i>Plotly JS</i> provides some <i>mapping charts</i>
    for geo-based data. Last but not least, there are <i>3D charts</i> and <i>animations</i>.
</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>
    To demonstrate the capabilities of <i>Plotly JS</i> we make a bar plot using our life expectancy dataset. For each
    region over the years we plot one bar. We have to structure the data stored in a <i>JSON</i> file in the
    following format:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plotly_data_format.png" class="lazyload" align="Plotly data format in JSON">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    where the value inside the variable <i>name</i> is assigned to a particular bar and appears in the legend. The lists
    <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> as their name implies, contain the values the plot is relating on the x and y-axis
    respectively.
</p>

<p>
    As previously seen, we have to successfully load the data and define the chart inside a callback function:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plotly_function.png" class="lazyload" alt="Plotly JS function signature">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    After the successful data loading, we create a <i>JavaScript</i> object named <i>layout</i> and inside we set
    the bar plot options. First, we can set the title and specify that there will be a group of bars with a certain
    gap between them:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plotly_layout.png" class="lazyload" alt="Plotly bar chart layout definition">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    Using the same object, we can easily set the x and y-axis options. Thus, we set the title, the tick options as
    well as the range of values for each axis:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plotly_x_y_axis.png" class="lazyload" alt="Plotly bar chart set x and y axis options">
</center>
<br/>

The resulting bar chart is shown in the image below. The interactive web version of the plot can be found
<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/plotly_index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/plotly_bar_chart.png" class="lazyload" alt="Plotly bar chart">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Figure 4:</i> Plotly bar chart for the life expectancy data. Try it
        <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/plotly_index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </span>
</center>

<h3>Last words</h3>

<p>
    The charts generated with <i>Plotly JS</i> include many features. Firstly, they are interactive, showing the
    values associated with their label in a box as we move through the plot. Furthermore, the legend is interactive
    allowing us to select what bar plots to keep active. As an example, we can select only one bar and disable the rest.
</p>

<p>
    One powerful feature is the toolbar that appears on top of the plot. It has many useful functionalities allowing
    us to easily manipulate the plot. For instance, we can download the plot as an image, zoom over it and select a
    subset of values on each axis to have a better look at them.
</p>

<h2>ApexCharts JS: À-propos</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://apexcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ApexCharts JS</a> is an open-source library for
    interactive charts. Its main goal is to provide web developers a way to create and integrate into their
    web applications a large variety of charts in a straightforward manner. It has an interesting UI with specific
    bright colors providing a unique experience.
</p>

<h3>Popularity and maintainability</h3>

<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/apexcharts/apexcharts.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a>
    repository containing the full development is well maintained. It is very well documented with tones of examples
    and clarifications. It has 8400 stars and it is used in another 4800 repositories, which is a good indicator
    that it is attractive. However, the number of forks is relatively low compared to the other popular libraries,
    only 447.
</p>

<p>
    One additional factor is the collaboration of <i>ApexCharts</i> with
    <a href="https://www.fusioncharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FusionCharts</a>, another provider of
    web and mobile visualization utilities. This additionally enhances the support and diversity of the
    available charts.
</p>

<h3>Palette of charts </h3>
<p>
    <i>ApexCharts JS</i> contains a group of simple and easy-to-produce charts and more advanced charts. In the simple
    charts, we can find the standard <i>line</i>, <i>area</i> and <i>bar</i> charts as well as the mix between them.
    Furthermore, in this group of simple charts, there are the <i>candlestick</i>, <i>bubble</i> and <i>scatter</i>
    plots. Finally, we have a <i>heatmap</i>, <i>pie</i>, and <i>radialbar</i>.
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/apex_examples.png" class="lazyload" alt="ApexCharts JS chart gallery">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Figure 5:</i> ApexCharts JS chart gallery.
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    In the more advanced types of charts, one can find the <i>Chord</i> and <i>Sankey</i> diagrams used for
    representing flows. In addition, there are <i>Funnel</i>, <i>Pyramid</i> and <i>Sunburst</i> charts.
    There are also many advanced statistical charts. A reference to all charts can be found
    <a href="https://apexcharts.com/javascript-chart-demos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here.</a>
</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>
    To test <i>ApexCharts JS</i> we create a multiline chart on top of our life expectancy data set. The data must
    be stored in a <i>JSON</i> file using the following format:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/apex_data_format.png" class="lazyload" align="ApexCharts data format in JSON">
</center>
<br/>


<p>
    As usual, we must load the data from a JSON data file and upon the successful loading to define the chart
    in a callback function. For instance, we load and define the chart in the following function:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/apex_function.png" class="lazyload" alt="ApexCharts JS function signature">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    Then, we create an object named <i>options</i> and inside we define the multi-line chart components. We can start
    by defining the data to plot, the title, and some basic chart properties:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/apex_option.png" class="lazyload" alt="ApexCharts JS multi-line chart layout definition">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    Finally, in the same object we can specify the x and y-axis details like the data type, the range of values
    and the title:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/apex_x_y_axis.png" class="lazyload" alt="ApexCharts JS set x and y axis options">
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    In the end, the line chart will look like the one presented in Figure 6 below. There is an interactive web
    version to play with it, which can be found
    <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/apex_index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/apex_line_chart.png" class="lazyload" alt="ApexCharts JS line chart">
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Figure 6:</i> ApexCharts JS multi-line chart for the life expectancy data. Try it
        <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/apex_index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </span>
</center>


<h3>Last words</h3>

<p>
    Similarly, as the other tools, it is also quite simple to produce charts using the <i>ApexCharts JS</i>
    tool. All charts are interactive with a possibility to zoom over a subset of values for a better analysis.
    However, once we select a range of values, there is no way to restart the selection and get back in the previous
    state.
</p>

<p>
    The legend is interactive as well. We can disable and then enable again a certain line by clicking
    on the legend item associated with it. Moreover, only by hovering the mouse pointer over one of the legend
    items, the line associated with that item stands out while all other lines get transparent.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    In this blog post, we had a more thorough overview of the charting <i>JavaScript</i> libraries. In general,
    we differentiate 4 types of <i>JavaScript</i> visualization libraries depending on their functionality:
    charting, graphs, maps, and 3D.
</p>

<p>
    Out of the many charting libraries, we make a hands-on demonstration with <i>NVD3</i>, <i>Plotly JS</i>
    and <i>ApexCharts JS</i> using the <i>life expectancy</i> data set. We also give an overview of what
    these tools provide and how reliable they are.
