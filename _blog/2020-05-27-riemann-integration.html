    The <i>integral</i> is not so complicated as it seems to be. It is one of the fundamental and universal tools in
    mathematics allowing us to calculate the area or the volume of any arbitrary body. It is one of the cornerstones
    of mathematics having a multitude of applications in many disciplines.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Riemann Integral</a>
    is the simplest form of integration, yet it lays down the foundation of all other types of integrals. It offers a
    rigorous method for approximating the area under the curve of some function \( f \) over some interval \( [a, b] \).
    This fact assigns to it an intuitive geometrical interpretation.
</p>

<p>
    In this blog post we will introduce and elaborate more on the <i>Riemann Integration</i>. We will start with
    intuitive reasoning on the process of integration in order to have a smooth transition towards the mathematical
    foundations. Then, we will see how to transform the theory into an easy <i>Python</i> implementation. Finally, we
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _blog/2020-02-08-interactive-dataviz.html %}" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">visually enhance</a>
    and complement our understanding with an animated visualization of the Riemann Sums using the
    <i>Matplotlib's Animation API</i>.
</p>

<h2>Intuition</h2>

<p>
    We can easily calculate the area of any regular-shaped bodies like the rectangle because it consists of only
    straight lines. Thus, for a rectangle with width \( m \) and height \( n \), the area is calculated as simple
    as \(m \times n \). It is straightforward to deduct this because for every small unit on the side \( m \) there
    is still a regular rectangle with height \( n \).
</p>

<p>
    However, if we only change the top side from a straight line to some <i>arbitrary</i> line that can be described with some
    <i>non-linear</i> function, the circumstances get complicated. We can still divide the surface in small rectangles, but now, they
    have varying height and on top of this, they do not entirely fit inside the body. This is illustrated in the image
    below:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/calculate_area.png" class="lazyload" alt="Calculate area of regular and irregular shape bodies"/>
    <br/>
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Fig. 1:</i> Area of regular and irregular bodies
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    Now, to reduce the calculation error we would need to fit <b>infinitely many</b> rectangles inside the irregular body.
    This leads us to the definition of the <i>Riemann Integral</i> which has exactly the same geometrical motivation
    and interpretation. We only need to give a more rigorous definition of this procedure, which we do in the next
    section.
</p>

<h2>Riemann Integration Definition</h2>

<p>
    To formally define the <i>Riemann Integral</i>, we start with some real function \( f: [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \)
    which is non-negative (it includes zero values) and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">continuous</a>
    over the interval \( [a, b] \). This is our <b>arbitrary top line</b> in the example above depicted in Figure 1.
    To complete the missing parts, we need to define the <b>widths</b> and <b>heights</b> of the mini rectangles.
</p>

<p>
    To define the rectangles' <b>widths</b>, we make a partition of the interval \( [a, b] \). That means we divide the
    interval \( [a, b] \) into \( N \) sub-intervals for some \( N \in \mathbb{N} \), i.e.
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/riemann_partition.png" class="lazyload" alt="Math expression for a partition of an interval"/>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    For simplicity reasons we can consider all sub-intervals equidistant, although in the general case they can take any
    length. Thus, the width of any rectangle would be \( w = (b - a) \div N \), such that for any \( i \in [1, N] \) it
    holds that \( x_{i} - x_{i-1} = w = (b - a) \div N \).
</p>

<p>
    To define the rectangles' <b>heights</b>, we simply chose a random point from each sub-interval, i.e.
    \( x_{i}^{*} \in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}] \) for any \( i \in [1, N] \). To make things easier, we select this
    point to be the left-most one, i.e. \( x_{i}^{*} = x_{i-1} \). Thus, the height of each mini rectangle
    is \( f(x_{i - 1}) \) for \( i \in [1, N] \).
</p>

<p>
    Having said all of this, the formal and <b>simplified</b> definition of the <i>Riemann Integral</i> is as follows:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/riemann_sum.png" class="lazyload" alt="Math equation of the Riemann Integral with Rectangles"/>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    However, this simple definition is too lossy and it would need a large \( N \) to converge properly. To escape this
    limitation, we make a simple trick: transforming the <i>mini rectangles</i> to
    <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RightTrapezoid.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><i>mini right trapezoids</i></a>.
    The right trapezoids fit better under the curve, accounting for the loss, as depicted in the figure below:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rectangles_to_trapezoids.png" class="lazyload" alt="Approximating area under the curve with trapezoids instead of rectangles"/>
    <br/>
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Fig. 2:</i> The difference between rectangles and right trapezoids
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    With this in mind, we only need to slightly modify our formal <i>Riemann Integral</i> definition. We switch from
    an area of a rectangle to an area of a right trapezoid. In literature, this is referred to as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Trapezoidal Rule</a>.
    In this case, the sum would be:
</p>

</center>
<br/>

<h2>Numerical Integration in Python</h2>

<p>
    We only need to translate the last equation into a <i>Python</i> set of instructions. Thus, the Python implementation
    is a piece of cake as given below:
</p>

    result *= w
    <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">return</span> result
</pre></td></tr></table></div>
<br/>

<p>
    Once we have the implementation, it is necessary to test it against some <i>universal mathematical truth</i>. For instance,
    it is well known and we can mathematically calculate that:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/approximating_pi_integral.png" class="lazyload" alt="Integral approximating Pi"/>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    To test the convergence of our numerical integration implementation, we calculate the <i>absolute difference</i> between the
    exact and approximated value of \( \pi \). Therefore, at the same time we try to approximate \( \pi \) and test our
    implementation.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, to enhance the <b>perception</b> of this approximation it is necessary to show a geometrical and <b>visual
    interpretation</b> of the process. For this reason, we make an animated visualization using <i>Matplotlib's</i>
    Animation API. We make the following observation: as the number of trapezoids \( N \) increase, the approximation
    error decrease. On top of that, we see how the number of trapezoids geometrically reflects in the calculation of
    the integral. The animation is shown below:
</p>

<center>
    <img data-src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/riemann_sum_animation.gif" class="lazyload" alt="Animation of the Riemann Sum">
    <br/>
    <span class="caption text-muted">
        <i>Animation: </i> Approximating Pi using the Riemann Sums
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    We can notice that for a fairly small number of trapezoids, i.e. 200 in total, the approximation error is already
    in an order of magnitude of \( 10^{-5} \). That means our implementation is correct, although we can
    apply additional error bound analysis.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    In this short blog post, we extended our general geometry knowledge to calculate the area of some irregular-shaped
    bodies. We achieved this with the simplest form of integration, the <b>Riemann Sums</b>, for which we gave a formal
    definition. Later on, we provided a straightforward Python implementation and an animated visualization of the
    integration process using Matplotlib's Animation API.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>Riemann Integral</b> is one simple but yet powerful tool to calculate the area under the curve. However,
    the fact that we fit mini rectangles or trapezoids inside the area is quite limiting. More generally, the body
    can have any irregular shape for which we need other methods like the <i>Stieltjes</i> or <i>Lebesgue</i>
    integrals.
