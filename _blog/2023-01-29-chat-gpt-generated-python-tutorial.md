**DRAFT version**


ChatGPT has outstanding capabilities to explain code. This can serve as an excellent tool to teach programming as "programming is learned by programming".
Following this premise, using ChatGPT I compiled a [document](https://github.com/IlievskiV/the-100-page-chat-gpt-generated-python-tutorial/blob/main/100_page_chat_gpt_generated_python_tutorial.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
containing explanations for 100 Python exercises for complete beginners. One exercise per page.

To generate the content of this document we used two resources:
- A pre-compiled list of Python exercises and
- The [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/){:target="_blank"}  Large Language Model

The exercises in this documents were taken from the  [Break The Ice With Python](https://github.com/darkprinx/break-the-ice-with-python){:target="_blank"} GitHub repository. 
The repository contains more than 100 simple Python exercises aimed for beginners.

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/){:target="_blank"}  is a revolutionary large language model. It is capable of generating text on literally any subject. 
The model is quite good in generating explanations of code snippets. This serves as a good tool to teach programming as demonstrated in this document.

To obtain the code explanations we prompted ChatGPT with the following prompt:

```plain
Explain me the following code snippet written in Python as explaining
it to someone who doesn't know programming in Python
```

after which the coding exercise in Python followed.

All the resources can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/IlievskiV/the-100-page-chat-gpt-generated-python-tutorial" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.
