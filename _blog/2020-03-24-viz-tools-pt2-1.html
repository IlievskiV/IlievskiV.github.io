<p>
    There are plenty of <i>JavaScript</i> Visualization tools. Based on their functionality, we can cluster them
    into 4 main categories:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Charting: to produce the most common DataViz plots;</li>
    <li>Graphs: representing and analyzing graph-based data;</li>
    <li>Maps: for representing data that has geo-features and</li>
    <li>3D: creating three-dimensional charts and cool animations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In the previous <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _blog/2020-03-10-viz-tools-pt1.html %}" target="_blank">blog post</a>,
    we started our <i>JavaScript</i> visualization trip with an overview of the charting libraries. This time we take
    a look at the tools for plotting graph-based data.
</p>

<p>
    A <strong>graph</strong> is a special data structure composed of <i>nodes</i> and <i>edges</i> between them.
    Each graph <i>node</i> is a unique entity in <i>relation</i> to other nodes. This relation
    is represented with an <i>edge</i>. In mathematics and computer sciences, there is a full
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graph theory</a> dealing with
    and analyzing the properties of the graphs. In the figure below, we see one graph example.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    The <strong>goal</strong> of this post is to give an overview of the graph-visualization ecosystem composed
    of numerous data formats and repositories from one side and plenty of <i>JavaScript</i> low-level libraries as well
    as out-of-the-box tools on the other side. <strong>Stay tuned!</strong>
</p>

<h2>Data Formats</h2>

<p>
    The graphs have a specific structure consisting of <i>nodes</i> and <i>edges</i> between them which requires special
    structuring of the data used to model and represent them. For this reason, there exist several conventions
    to store the graph-based data ranging from very simple formats to very complex that can store arbitrary data.
    These data formats include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>CSV</strong>: the simplest file format storing the information in a delimited text.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>DOT</strong>: simple and easily understandable format supported by
        <a href="https://www.graphviz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphViz</a>, an open-source tool for
        graph visualization. More useful information can be found on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wikipedia</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>GDF</strong>: a database-like file system that can be easily converted from <i>CSV</i>. It is officially used by
        <a href="http://graphexploration.cond.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GUESS</a>, an exploratory data
        analysis and visualization tool for graphs and networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>GML</strong>: the Graph Modelling Language is a hierarchical file format with key-value lists. Its aim is to support
        flexibility and portability. It is supported by many tools. More information can be found on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wikipedia</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>GraphML</strong>: is an <i>XML</i> based file format. This gives the format a lot of expressiveness power and we can
        define and represent many different graph structures. Many tools have adopted this file format. The full
        documentation, as well as specification, can be found on the official
        <a href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphML website</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>GEXF</strong>: abbreviated from Graph Exchange XML format, as its name implies is also an <i>XML</i> format. It was
        designed by <a href="https://gephi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gephi</a>, an open-source graph
        visualization platform, with a goal to describe complex and exchangeable network structures. To find out
        more check the <i>Gephi's</i>
        <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gexf/wiki/Basic-Concepts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GitHub Wiki Page</a>
        describing the format.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    A nice summary of all possible graph file formats can be found on the <i>Gephi's</i> website on
    <a href="https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Supported Graph Formats</a>
    page. For convenience reasons we summarize the above-mentioned formats and their properties in the table below:

<h2>Data Repositories</h2>

<p>
    In order to facilitate the network and graph-analysis research, there are plenty of data repositories. These
    data sources contain tones of data in diverse and numerous domains including biology, machine learning, social
    sciences, physics, etc. Some of the most popular repositories are the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>SNAP Collection:</strong> hosted by <i>Stanford University</i>, this collection is part of the
        Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) which is a <i>C++</i> graph-mining and network analysis library.
        More than 100 well-documented data sets, nicely clustered in various areas can be found on the official SNAP
        <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Network Repository:</strong> one of the largest repositories for network and graph data in more than
        30 domains. All the data is nicely documented and organized on the
        <a href="http://networkrepository.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official web page</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>KONECT:</strong> which is an abbreviation of <i>the Koblenz Network Collection</i> is a collaboration
        whose aim is to collect various types of large network data sets in order to boost the network research.
        The <a href="http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data repository</a> holds
        more than 260 well-maintained data sets.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>UCI Network Repository:</strong> is maintained by the <i>University of California</i> with the goal
        to facilitate the research in this domain. The
        <a href="https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/resources.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">repo</a>
        contains many different network data sets as well as links to other useful data sources.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Graph Visualization Libraries</h2>

<p>
    The JavaScript Graph Visualization landscape is quite rich and contains dozens of libraries. Some of these libraries
    are nicely summarized in the top-right corner of the image above. This list is not exhaustive of course, there are
    many other tools not listed here. In this
    <a href="https://medium.com/@Elise_Deux/the-list-of-graph-visualization-libraries-7a7b89aab6a6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Medium story</a>,
    you can find a more comprehensive list.

    In the following section, we briefly overview the following GraphViz libraries: <i>Cytoscape JS</i>,
    <i>Sigma JS</i>, <i>Cola</i>, <i>VivaGraph JS</i>, and <i>Springy JS</i>.
</p>

<p>
    All these libraries are open-source and everyone can contribute to their development. Their implementation is
    hosted on <i>GitHub</i>. For this reason, in the figure below we summarize their <i>GitHub</i> stats as of the
    date of publishing of this post. These stats might be a good indicator of the development activity and popularity
    of the library.
</p>

        <i>Figure 2:</i> GitHub stats for some of the Graph Visualization Open-Source Libraries
    </span>
</center>
<br/>

<p>
    It is worth mentioning that all of these libraries allow us to explore the data interactively, which is quite
    important as we have demonstrated in the blog
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _blog/2020-02-08-interactive-dataviz.html %}" target="_blank">"The Importance of Interactive Data Visualization"</a>:

        The human-computer interaction is more immersive and the results are more interpretable.
    </i>
</blockquote>

<h3>Cytoscape JS</h3>

<p>
    Initially developed to analyze and visualize biological and molecular interactions and networks,
    <a href="https://cytoscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cytoscape</a>
    evolved furthermore as a general-purpose graph visualization and network analysis tool. The
    <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">JavaScript API</a>
    augments the out-of-the-box tool to create nice graph plots in many interdisciplinary areas as summarized
    in their <a href="https://cytoscape.org/screenshots.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gallery</a>
    of examples.
</p>

<h3>Sigma JS</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://sigmajs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma JS</a> is an open-source tool mainly focused
    on deploying interactive graph visualizations in web applications. It is based on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WebGL</a>
    (or alternatively on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Canvas</a>)
    to render efficiently the graphs in the browser. On the official
    <a href="https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopene">GitHub</a> repository, we can
    find many interesting examples as well as proper
    <a href="https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/wiki" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3>Cola JS</h3>

<p>
    The open-source JavaScript library <a href="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/webcola/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cola</a>
    (which stands for Constrained Layout), or also known as <i>WebCola</i> is not a standalone graph-visualization
    library. It is rather an implementation of a constraint-based algorithm for drawing graph layouts. This library
    complements the other libraries with graph visualization capabilities like <i>D3</i> or <i>Cytoscape</i>.
</p>

<h3>VivaGraph JS</h3>

<p>
    Among the other alternatives is the <i>VivaGraph JS</i> library which provides a nice API for rendering graphs on
    the web using many different engines and layouts. The official
    <a href="https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GitHub repo</a> provides
    introductory guidelines as well as examples of how to use the library.
</p>

<h3>Springy JS</h3>

<p>
    <a href="http://getspringy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Springy JS</a> is another open-source tool designed
    to be lightweight to use. Thus, it only provides a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">force-directed</a>
    layout with simple graph-manipulation capabilities. Same as with many other tools, it is possible to use
    either <i>WebGL</i>, <i>Canvas</i> or <i>SVG</i> rendering engine.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    In this blog post, we analyzed the <i>Graph Visualization</i> ecosystem. We started with a short introduction to the
    graph data structure. Then we continued presenting the different data formats to store a graph and where to find
    such data. Afterward, we briefly overviewed some popular <i>JavaScript</i> open-source graph visualization
    libraries.
</p>


<h2>Appendix: GUI-based tools</h2>
<p>
    Aside from the programming interfaces that allow us to explicitly program the graph visualization, there
    are many out-of-the-box tools. These tools can automatically load data, with support for many different file
    formats. On top of this, they provide functionalities to manipulate and analyze the graphs in real-time.
</p>

<p>
    In this appendix, we briefly summarize the following two tools: <i>Gephi</i> and <i>GraphVis</i>.
    You can find a comprehensive list of many of these tools in the following
    <a href="https://medium.com/@Elise_Deux/list-of-free-graph-visualization-applications-9c4ff5c1b3cd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Medium story</a>.
</p>

<h3>Gephi</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://gephi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gephi</a> is a free, open-source and multi-platform tool.
    It was designed and developed to enable real-time rendering and analysis of huge graphs. Thus, it contains a special
    3D engine that only uses the <i>GPU</i> and leaves the <i>CPU</i> free. Moreover, it implements a fast and efficient
    constraint-optimization algorithm called <i>Force Atlas</i> in order to draw the graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing
    way. Apart from this, <i>Gephi</i> defined and developed the <i>GEXF</i> file format as we described before.
</p>


<h3>GraphVis</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://graphvis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphVis</a> is a web-based commercial tool that
    empowers real-time interactive graph mining and relational machine learning (link prediction, finding
    influential nodes). Its GUI is very appealing and enables users to interactively query, filter and find patterns
    in one complex network of nodes and edges.
